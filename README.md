# Space-Invaders
I have kept the styling at a bare miniumum for you to go wild and make it your own. Please tag me as I would LOVE to see your game!!!  Space Invaders is a simple grid-based game in which you as the shooter have to shoot down as many alien invaders before they get to you. We are going to build a 15 x 15 grid square with 20 invaders to shoot.   In this repo, I will be putting extra focus on for loops and classLists in JavaScript
